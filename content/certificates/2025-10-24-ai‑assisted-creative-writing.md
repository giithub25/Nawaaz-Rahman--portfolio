caption: I completed the Udemy course “Creative Writing Using ChatGPT,” offered
  by ExpertEase Education. This short program introduced me to new ways of
  approaching writing with the support of AI. I practiced generating ideas,
  shaping narratives, and refining drafts while keeping my own voice at the
  center of the process. The course showed me how AI can act as a partner in
  creativity, helping to overcome blocks and spark fresh directions without
  replacing the human touch. This certificate reflects my interest in exploring
  how technology can support storytelling and communication, and how creative
  work can evolve with the right tools.
