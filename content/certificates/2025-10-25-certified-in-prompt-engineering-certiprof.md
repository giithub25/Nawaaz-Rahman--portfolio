caption: I earned the Prompt Engineering Foundation certification from CertiProf
  after completing a structured assessment focused on designing effective
  prompts for AI systems. The program helped me understand how language
  interacts with models, and how small changes in phrasing can lead to better,
  more reliable outputs. It also emphasized clarity, intent, and
  adaptabilityâ€”skills I now apply when working with tools like ChatGPT, image
  generators, and automation platforms. This certification reflects my
  commitment to mastering the fundamentals of prompt design and using them to
  build smarter, more responsive workflows across creative and technical
  projects
